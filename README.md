# Swift Struct vs Classes

```
struct cannot be inherited and doesn't support encapsulation
let cannot be used for mutable functions
struct will be destroyed and created with updated properties when mutable keyword is used.
struct has passed by value whereas classes are passed by reference
all variables should be initialized inside classes whether using constructor or while declaration
variables can be uninitialized at struct
```
